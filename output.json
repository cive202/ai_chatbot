        "text": "Flutter SDK - Khalti Payment Gateway\nSkip to content\nKhalti Flutter SDK\n¶\nKhalti Payment Gateway SDK for Flutter with default payment interface, works out of the box without having to add any additional user interface.\nKhalti Payment Gateway for Flutter\nIntroduction\n¶\nRead the introduction\nhere\n.\nGetting Started\n¶\nIntegrating Khalti Payment Gateway requires merchant account. \nYou can always\ncreate one easily from here\n.\nTip\nA merchant account is required for integration.\nAccess Information\nFor Sandbox Access\nSignup from\nhere\nas a merchant.\nPlease use 987654 as login OTP for sandbox env.\nFor Production Access\nPlease visit\nhere\nTest Credentials for sandbox environment\nTest Khalti ID for\n9800000000\n9800000001\n9800000002\n9800000003\n9800000004\n9800000005\nTest MPIN\n1111\nTest OTP\n987654\nRead the steps to integrate Khalti Payment Gateway in details\nhere\n.\nSupported Platforms\n¶\nAndroid\niOS\nWeb\nDesktop (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n✔️\n✔️\n❌\n❌\nSetup\n¶\nDetailed setup for each platform.\nAndroid\n¶\nNo configuration is required for android.\niOS\n¶\nNo configuration is required for iOS.\nLaunching Payment Interface\n¶\nGenerating the pidx\n¶\nA unique product identifier\npidx\nmust be generated via a server side POST request before being able to proceed. Read\nhere\nfor information on how one can generate pidx along with other extra parameters.\nKhalti Initialization\n¶\nBefore being able to launch Khalti payment gateway, it is necessary to initialize\nKhalti\nobject. The initialization can be done by a static\ninit()\nmethod.\nIt is suggested that the initialization be done inside the\ninitState\nmethod of a\nStatefulWidget\n.\nclass\nKhaltiSDKDemo\nextends\nStatefulWidget\n{\nconst\nKhaltiSDKDemo\n({\nsuper\n.\nkey\n});\n@override\nState\n<\nKhaltiSDKDemo\n>\ncreateState\n()\n=>\n_KhaltiSDKDemoState\n();\n}\nclass\n_KhaltiSDKDemoState\nextends\nState\n<\nKhaltiSDKDemo\n>\n{\nlate\nfinal\nFuture\n<\nKhalti\n>\nkhalti\n;\n@override\nvoid\ninitState\n()\n{\nsuper\n.\ninitState\n();\nfinal\npayConfig\n=\nKhaltiPayConfig\n(\npublicKey:\n'__live_public_key__'\n,\n// Merchant's public key\npidx:\npidx\n,\n// This should be generated via a server side POST request.\nenvironment:\nEnvironment\n.\nprod\n,\n);\nkhalti\n=\nKhalti\n.\ninit\n(\nenableDebugging:\ntrue\n,\npayConfig:\npayConfig\n,\nonPaymentResult:\n(\npaymentResult\n,\nkhalti\n)\n{\nlog\n(\npaymentResult\n.\ntoString\n());\n},\nonMessage:\n(\nkhalti\n,\n{\ndescription\n,\nstatusCode\n,\nevent\n,\nneedsPaymentConfirmation\n,\n})\nasync\n{\nlog\n(\n'Description:\n$\ndescription\n, Status Code:\n$\nstatusCode\n, Event:\n$\nevent\n, NeedsPaymentConfirmation:\n$\nneedsPaymentConfirmation\n'\n,\n);\n},\nonReturn:\n()\n=>\nlog\n(\n'Successfully redirected to return_url.'\n),\n);\n}\n@override\nWidget\nbuild\n(\nBuildContext\ncontext\n)\n{\n// Rest of the code\n}\n}\nBREAKING CHANGE\nStarting with version\n1.0.0-dev.5\n, it is no longer necessary for the developers to manually add\nreturn_url\nwithin\nKhaltiPayConfig\n. The SDK handles the fetching and proper usage of\nreturn_url\n.\nThe static\ninit()\nmethod takes in a few arguments:\nenableDebugging\n: A boolean argument that is when set to true can be used to view network logs in the debug console. It is set to\nfalse\nby default.\npayConfig\n: An instance of\nKhaltiPayConfig()\n. It is used to set few config data. The instance of\nKhaltiPayConfig\ntakes in few arguments:\nfinal\npayConfig\n=\nKhaltiPayConfig\n(\npublicKey:\n'__live_public_key__'\n,\n// Merchant's public key\npidx:\npidx\n,\n// This should be generated via a server side POST request.\nenvironment:\nEnvironment\n.\nprod\n,\n);\npublicKey\n: Merchant's live or test public key provided by Khalti.\npidx\n: Unique product identifier received after initiating the payment via a server-side POST request.\nenvironment\n: An enum that determines whether test API or production API should be invoked. Can be either\nEnvironment.prod\nor\nEnvironment.test\n. Set to\nEnvironment.prod\nby default.\nonPaymentResult\n: A callback function that is triggered if the payment is successfully made and redirected to merchant's return URL. The callback takes in two arguments.\npaymentResult\n: An instance of\nPaymentResult\nclass. It provides some informations about the payment after it is successfully made. Following data is provided by this instance.\npayload\n: An instance of\nPaymentPayload\n. It contains general informations such as\npidx\n,\ntotalAmount\n,\ntransactionId\n,\nstatus\n,\nfee\n,\nrefunded\n,\npurchaseOrderId\n,\npurchaseOrderName\nand\nextraMerchantParams\nregarding the payment made.\nkhalti\n: An instance of\nKhalti\n. Can be used to invoke any methods provided by this instance.\nonPaymentResult\n(\npaymentResult\n,\nkhalti\n)\n{\nprint\n(\npaymentResult\n.\npayload\n?\n.\nstatus\n);\nprint\n(\npaymentResult\n.\npayload\n?\n.\npidx\n);\nprint\n(\npaymentResult\n.\npayload\n?\n.\ntotalAmount\n);\nprint\n(\npaymentResult\n.\npayload\n?\n.\ntransactionId\n);\n}\nonReturn\n: A callback function that gets triggered when the return_url is successfully loaded.\nonMessage\n: A callback function that is triggered to convey any message. It gets triggered when any issue is encountered or when any general message is to be conveyed. In case of error, this callback provides error informations such as error description and status code. It also provides information about why the error occured via\nKhaltiEvent\nenum. This enum consists of:\nenum\nKhaltiEvent\n{\n/// Event for when khalti payment page is disposed.\nkpgDisposed\n,\n/// Event for when return url fails to load from the API.\nreturnUrlLoadFailure\n,\n/// Event for when there's an exception when making a network call.\nnetworkFailure\n,\n/// Event for when there's a HTTP failure when making a network call for verifying payment status.\npaymentLookupfailure\n,\n/// An unknown event.\nunknown\n}\nAdditionally, it also provides a bool\nneedsPaymentConfirmation\nwhich needs to be checked. If it is true, developers should invoke payment confirmation API that is provided by the SDK to confirm the status of their payment. The callback also provides the instance of\nKhalti\n.\nonMessage:\n(\nkhalti\n,\n{\ndescription\n,\nstatusCode\n,\nevent\n,\nneedsPaymentConfirmation\n,\n})\n{\nlog\n(\n'Description:\n$\ndescription\n, Status Code:\n$\nstatusCode\n, Event:\n$\nevent\n, NeedsPaymentConfirmation:\n$\nneedsPaymentConfirmation\n'\n);\n}\nLoading payment interface\n¶\nThe SDK internally uses\nflutter_inappwebview\nto load the khalti payment gateway. SDK users should invoke\nopen()\nmethod provided by the SDK to push a new page in their route.\nkhalti\n.\nopen\n(\ncontext\n);\n// Assuming that khalti is a variable that holds the instance of `Khalti`.\nPayment verification API\n¶\nA payment verification API that confirms the status of the payment made, is already called by the SDK internally. However, if the users receive\nneedsPaymentConfirmation\nas true in\nonMessage\ncallback, they are supposed to called the payment verification API manually to be sure about the payment status. It can be done with a method provided by the\nKhalti\ninstance.\nawait\nkhalti\n.\nverify\n();\n// Assuming that khalti is a variable that holds the instance of `Khalti`.\nThe instance of\nKhalti\nis provided in the\nonPaymentResult\nand\nonMessage\ncallback which can be used to invoke any public functions provide by\nKhalti\nclass.\nClosing the Khalti payment gateway page\n¶\nAfter payment is successfully made, developers can opt to pop the page that was pushed in their route. The SDK provides a\nclose()\nmethod.\nkhalti\n.\nclose\n(\ncontext\n);\nExample\n¶\nFor a more detailed example, check the\nexamples\ndirectory inside\nkhalti_flutter\npackage.\nChangelog\n¶",

Please follow the documentation here to proceed\nWeb Checkout\n.\nCheckout provides all the necessary Uls and perform necessary processes to initiate and confirm the payment.\n2.2. Mobile Checkout\n¶\nThe payment process flow of KPG SDK (Android & Flutter) is as follows:\nMerchant requests Khalti  to initiate the online payment.\nKhalti system returns with\npidx\nand\npayment_url\n.\nThe merchant system must pass\npidx\n,\nkeys\nand\nreturn URL\nin client side SDK (Android and Flutter) for initiating the online payment.\nAfter payment, the return message is obtained on the client side along with extra SDK offerings.\nMerchant side must hit the lookup API to get the status of the transaction.\nNote\nThe return url  must be same while generating PIDX and in SDK To get callback or SDK offering\nIf you are looking to integrate KPG in mobile, then the integration must be done by integrating the provided SDKs.

        "text": "FAQ's and Gotchas - Khalti Payment Gateway\nSkip to content\nFAQ's\n¶\n1. How can I sign up as a merchant?\n¶\nPlease go this\nlink\nfor a merchant sign up\n2. How to integrate KPG?\n¶\nBased on your requirement please visit following links for Khalti integration:\nWeb integration\nAndroid integration\nFlutter integration\nKhalti integration via plugins\nFor WooCommerce\n3. What to do after a successful test transaction ?\n¶\nAfter a successful test transaction, you will able to accept payments live. However, before going live,\nplease contact our team for the necessary coordination\n4. Does Khalti have SDK for hybrid Apps?\n¶\nWe do have SDK for\nFlutter\n. But for hybrid apps based on other frameworks, we don't have a specific SDK. \nFind options in\nClient Integration\n, which support Khalti checkout integration with your app.\n5. Can I share merchant keys?\n¶\nSecret key\nmust not be shared with anyone. Ensure it does not get leaked by any means. If you key got compromised you can regenerate new one from your merchant dashboard.\n6. What is Khalti mPIN?\n¶\nKhalti mPIN is the four digit pin, used by the user while making payment of third party transactions.\nIt can created or changed at the Transaction Pin section under Account in khalti web and Settings in khalti app.\n7. I need to refund payment to the user. How can I refund a transaction?\n¶\nYou can refund the payment to the user from your dashboard.\nGotchas\n¶\nCORS issues\n¶\nIf you are getting CORS issues, read the docs again very thoroughly. You need to call verification API from your server to verify, so it is necessary to pass the data to your server first.\nServer errors\n¶\nIf you get error response \"Fee not found.\" while testing, check your fee and set fee between Rs. 10 to Rs. 200. If you are using live keys contact merchant support to find your transaction limits.\nPayment errors\n¶\nIf you get error response \"Amount must be less than 200.\" while testing, check you have complete all the contract process. If you are using live keys contact merchant support for further details.\nFrame Options and Clickjacking protection\n¶\nRefused to display 'https://khalti.com/payment/widget/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'.\nYou are using HTTP response header 'X-Frame-Options' that avoids\n<iframe>\nrendering when you set it to 'deny'. But Khalti gateway uses iframe payment form, to accept payment from Khalti you need to allow iframe at least for khalti.com. You have a configuration option 'allow-from' with x-frame-options to allow from a specific domain. You can simply do this in your server configuration:\nX-Frame-Options \"allow-from https://khalti.com\"\nBut using x-frame-options is not an internet standard. It is almost absolute; modern browsers like chrome and safari don't support it.  The recommended way is to use 'frame-ancestors'  CSP rule. (legacy browsers like IE do not support it ).\nSo also for this error:\nRefused to display 'https://khalti.com/payment/widget/' in a frame because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"frame-ancestors 'none'\".\nYou need to configure the server as:\nContent-Security-Policy frame-ancestors 'self' khalti.com *.khalti.com\nOne can use both the options for full browser compatibility. So, please change your server configuration accordingly.",

making the seat layout:\nDetermine the Total Number of Columns\nFor example, if\nno_of_column\nis 5, then the seat layout must have 5 columns.\nNote:\nThe value for each seat must be checked from left to right as shown in the table below:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nIterate for Each Cell\ndisplayName\n:\nIf \"na\", there is no seat.\nIf other than \"na\", that is the seat name or number.\nbookingStatus\n:\nIf \"na\", there is no seat.\nIf \"Yes\", the seat is booked.\nIf \"No\", the seat is available.\nResponse for No Seat\n{\n       \"displayName\": \"na\",\n       \"bookingStatus\": \"na\"\n   }\nResponse for Booked Seat\n{\n       \"displayName\": \"A1\",\n       \"bookingStatus\": \"Yes\"\n   }\nResponse for Available Seat\n{\n       \"displayName\": \"A2\",\n       \"bookingStatus\": \"No\"\n   }\nExample Seat Layout\n¶\nThis is how the seat layout might look based on the above responses:\nA1\nA2\nB1\nB2\nA3\nA4\nB3\nB4\nA5\nA6\nB5\nB6\nA7\nA8\nB7\nB8\nA9\nA10\nB9\nB10\nA11\nA12\nB11\nB12\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nConclusion\n¶\nThis API allows clients to retrieve seating information for a specified bus. Ensure the provided parameters are valid for successful responses.",

Depending on your choice, you can submit requests for ADSL services using the provided API endpoints. This API requires parameters such as a token, a unique reference, the amount, and the landline number to process the request.\nType: Single Step API\n¶\nURL:\n¶\nUnlimited:\n{{base_url}}/api/use/adsl-ul/\nVolume Based:\n{{base_url}}/api/use/adsl-vb/\nService Params:\n¶\nnumber:\n8-digit number (area code without 0 and landline number), e.g., 15522942\ntoken:\nYour authentication token\nreference:\nA unique reference for the transaction\namount:\nThe amount to be processed\nnumber:\nThe landline number in the required format\nValid Amounts for Both Unlimited & Volume Based:\n¶\n9 < Amount < 10001\nRegex:\n¶\n[  \n  {  \n    \"name\": \"LandLine\",  \n    \"slug\": \"\",  \n    \"pattern\": \"([0-9]{8})\",  \n    \"error_message\": \"Invalid LandLine number\"  \n  }  \n]\nRequest:\n¶\n{  \n  \"token\": \"token-provided\",  \n  \"reference\": \"unique-reference\",  \n  \"amount\": \"amount\",  \n  \"number\": \"number\"  \n}\nResponse:\n¶\nSuccess Response:\n¶\n{  \n  \"id\": 165,  \n  \"credits_consumed\": 10.0,  \n  \"status\": true,  \n  \"state\": \"Queued\",  \n  \"message\": \"Your operation has been submitted for processing.\",  \n  \"credits_available\": 1170  \n}\nUnsuccessful Response:\n¶\n{  \n  \"error_code\": \"1010\",  \n  \"message\": \"Validation error\",  \n  \"status\": false,  \n  \"error_data\":\n,  \n  \"details\": \"*\n*\"  \n}\nNote:\n¶\nCheck the\nstatus\nkey in the response to verify the response. If\nstatus\nis\nfalse\n, there is an issue with the request, and you should correct it. If\nstatus\nis\ntrue\n, the request is successfully submitted but is subject to third-party provider processing. If the\nstate\nis\nQueued\n, the request is being sent to the third-party provider, and you will receive an update on the final status (success or failure) via our DLR callback.\nDLR Sample:\n¶\n{  \n  \"reference\": \"Unique id sent by you\",  \n  \"amount\": \"amount\",  \n  \"status\": \"status\",  \n  \"detail\": \"detail regarding the service\"  \n}",

Use the “amount” key for payment and skip the getDiscount API before proceeding to the commit API.\nExample Customer ID:\n53905\nPackage Payment\n¶\nUsers can choose a package. The “amount” key in the detail API will be 0 in this case. Use the “packages” key for package details and proceed to the checkDiscount API to get the final discounted amount.\nExample Customer ID:\n47531\n1.
